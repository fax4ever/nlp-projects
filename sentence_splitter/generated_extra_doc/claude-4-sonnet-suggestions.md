Perfect! Let me explain how metrics work in your training setup and clarify an important distinction:

## üìä **How Metrics Work in Your Current Setup**

### **üîç What's Happening Now:**

1. **Training Loss** (what actually drives learning):
   - The model optimizes **CrossEntropyLoss** (automatic for token classification)
   - This loss function is what **actually updates the model weights**
   - The optimizer uses this loss to do backpropagation

2. **Evaluation Metrics** (what you see reported):
   - Your `compute_metrics` function calculates: precision, recall, f1, accuracy
   - These are computed using `seqeval` (sequence evaluation for NER/token classification)
   - These metrics are **only for monitoring/reporting** - they don't affect training!

### **üéØ Key Insight: Metrics ‚â† Training Objective**

Your current setup:
- **Trains on**: CrossEntropyLoss (standard for classification)
- **Evaluates with**: F1, precision, recall (for human understanding)

The F1 score you see is **just for monitoring** - the model doesn't optimize for it directly!

## üí° **How to "Enforce" F1 in Training**

### **Option 1: Early Stopping Based on F1**
- Stop training when F1 stops improving
- Use `load_best_model_at_end=True` and `metric_for_best_model="f1"`

### **Option 2: Custom Loss Function**
- Replace CrossEntropyLoss with a loss that directly optimizes F1
- More complex but directly targets your metric

### **Option 3: Class Weighting**
- If you have imbalanced classes (many 0s, few 1s for sentence endings)
- Adjust loss to focus more on the minority class

### **Option 4: Focal Loss**
- Helps with hard examples and class imbalance
- Often improves F1 for token classification

The **easiest approach** is Option 1 - use early stopping based on F1 score to pick the best model!
