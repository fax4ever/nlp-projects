\section{Introduction}

\section{Methodology}

explain your starting hypothesis and the methods you will use to test them

\subsection{Embedding-based}

\subsection{LLM-based}

\section{Experiments}

explain your experimental setup; here you give technical details on
models, resources, etc. and how you implemented what you described before

Test the model(s) on the OOD.
Building a sentence splitter that actually works Out-of-Domain (ODD) is a non-trivial task in NLP.

\subsection{Results}

present the results referencing tables and commenting them, i.e., why you
accept or refuse your starting hypothesis and how you explain the (most
notable/unexpected) results.

Comparative analysis of the two approaches on the validation set – which one is
better?
